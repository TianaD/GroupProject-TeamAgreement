### **Presentation Deck**

Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

Schedule your practice session

Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.

When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.

Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”
